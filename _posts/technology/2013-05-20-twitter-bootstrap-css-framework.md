## What is Bootstrap?

"We are happy to announce Bootstrap, a front-end toolkit for rapidly
developing web applications. It is a collection of CSS and HTML
conventions. It uses some of the latest browser techniques to provide
you with stylish typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation
and everything else you need in a super tiny (only 6k with gzip)
resource. Check out Bootstrap on Github."

In short, it makes your life easier for both simple and complex web
development along with providing fantastic cross-browser and mobile
support - for no extra effort by you the developer!

I'm sold..
