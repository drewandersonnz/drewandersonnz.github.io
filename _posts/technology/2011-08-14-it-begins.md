So I'm giving wordpress a go.. I'll be writing about a number of different
things over the coming days, stay tuned!

I've recently been working on some pretty interesting projects, some which
have been very successful at their design goals and have become the
cornerstone for an entire company providing plenty of extremely useful
information for people to draw interesting conclusions from.

I'm very proud of the stuff I've managed to create, not to mention it has
allowed me to play amongst some very interesting players including
providing solutions for the BBC and Electronic Arts.

Stay tuned for more as time goes on. I'm sure to let slip a few secrets
every now and then...
