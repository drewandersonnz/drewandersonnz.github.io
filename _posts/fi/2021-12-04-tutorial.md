It may sounds very simple, but thats because it is.

## Earn Money
Doesn't need to be a lot, as long as you can earn more than you spend then you can start to think about Financial Independence.

## Control your expenses
Don't go spend hundreds at the bar/pub on the weekend. Take it easy, find the cheaper things to enjoy.

## Decide what to do with your savings
Savings isn't all about just having cash, its about having freedom to spend that cash where you see appropriate.

## Recognise that it takes time
Not only does it take time to start getting returns, but it takes time for you to learn the best places to get those returns. You will always lose money in the beginning because you literally have no idea! Take it easy on yourself, invest smaller so mistakes don't hurt as much, but whatever you do go and make those mistakes! It's the only way you'll learn!

## Invest everything you can
Keep your "rainy day fund" safe, and make sure you're not financially over-stretching in any way. Once you know that is under control and you know how much you can afford, then do it! Invest that money! Get that money working for you!
